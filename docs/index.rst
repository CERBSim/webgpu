WebGPU from Python
==================

This project provides a Python-first interface to the browser's WebGPU API
for **interactive visualization and compute** in Jupyter notebooks and
exported HTML pages, while hiding most of the low-level WebGPU boilerplate
behind a small rendering framework.

This documentation is split into several parts:

* **Getting started** - installation, a minimal "first scene" example and
  a quick overview of the main concepts.
* **User guide** - core concepts, renderers, scenes, selection and
  compute use cases.
* **Interactive tutorials (notebooks)** - downloadable notebooks that you
  can run locally in Jupyter.
* **API reference** - automatically generated reference for the main
  ``webgpu`` modules.
