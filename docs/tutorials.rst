Interactive tutorials
=====================

This project ships several Jupyter notebooks that act as interactive
"live" tutorials. The official tutorial notebooks are stored in the
repository's ``tutorials/`` folder.

Running the notebooks
---------------------

**Locally**
   1. Install ``webgpu`` (see :doc:`getting_started`).
   2. Copy or clone the repository so you have access to the
      ``tutorials/`` folder.
   3. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the repository root.
   4. Open one of the notebooks inside ``tutorials/`` and execute the
      cells.


Download all tutorials as a ZIP
-------------------------------

For convenience, the documentation build produces a ZIP archive of the
``tutorials/`` folder (containing all ``.ipynb`` tutorial notebooks). You
can download it here:
